description: "MobileNetV3-Large is a lightweight and efficient image classification model tailored for high-performance applications on mobile and embedded devices. It combines MobileNetV2’s inverted residuals with enhancements like squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, hard-swish activation, and neural architecture search for optimal speed-accuracy trade-offs."
