Task runner protocol definitions.

This module defines generic protocols for task runners and runner factories, enabling the implementation of pluggable,
type-safe execution engines for isolated workloads.
Runners are responsible for starting, stopping, and monitoring tasks, while factories produce runner instances for
specific task types.

Classes:
    Runner: Protocol for a task runner, supporting start, stop, and event streaming.
    RunnerFactory: Protocol for creating Runner instances for given tasks.
