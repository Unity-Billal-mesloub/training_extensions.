    Thread-based runner for testing job execution without process overhead.

    Experimental: This class is experimental and intended for development and testing only.

    This runner executes jobs in a separate thread and communicates events through a thread-safe queue, mimicking the
    behavior of ProcessRun but without the overhead of process creation. Designed specifically for integration
    testing where fast execution and easy debugging are prioritized over process isolation.

    Note: This implementation sacrifices process isolation for performance and debuggability.
    Use ProcessRun for production scenarios requiring fault isolation between jobs.
